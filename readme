Game: Scrabble
How to play:
	This game follow the general rules of Scrabble. However, it does not count tiles that 
	have not been placed by the player during their turn. Players can play tiles, set a 
	new value for a blank tile, and replace a tile during their turn, which is displayed 
	on the end turn button. Played tiles are outlined in red on the Scrabble board as 
	well as the playable tiles each player has. The tiles are replaced at the end of a 
	players' turn or when requested. When the "bag" runs out of tiles, this is shown 
	by the tiles being replaced with the symbol "-" instead of a letter.
	
Illegal moves that the program will still allow:
	- can place a tile anywhere on the board
	- can place a tile over one that has already been placed on the board

Assumptions:
	- players know how to spell
	- players use blank tile directly after setting its new value

Features:
	- Can replace a tile
	- Fill in a value for a blank tile (points will still not be allocated for this tile)
